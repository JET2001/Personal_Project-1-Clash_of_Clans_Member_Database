QUERY #1A ------ TO PRINT OUT A TABLE FROM DATABASE
(index.php)
SELECT Members.IGN, Positions.Position, Members.Thlvl, Members.TeleName
FROM Members JOIN Positions
ON Members.PositionID = Positions.PositionID
ORDER BY Members.PositionID ASC, Members.Thlvl DESC

QUERY #2 -----------
(addmember.php - Adds a member to the database)
INSERT INTO Members(IGN, PositionID, Thlvl, TeleName, Bio, Strategies) VALUES ($name, $pos_ID, $th, $te, $bi, $st);

QUERY #3 -----------
(delmember.php - This deletes a member from database)
DELETE FROM Members WHERE Members.MemberID = "$name";

QUERY #4 -----------
(donations.php)
// ORDERED BY Net Donations:

SELECT Members.IGN, Donations.Donated, Donations.Received, Donations.Net, Dates.Date
FROM Members JOIN Donations JOIN Dates
ON Members.MemberID = Donations.MemberID
and Donations.DateID = Dates.DateID
ORDER BY Donations.DateID DESC, Donations.Net DESC;

//ORDERED BY Donations
SELECT Members.IGN, Donations.Donated, Donations.Received, Donations.Net, Dates.Date
FROM Members JOIN Donations JOIN Dates
ON Members.MemberID = Donations.MemberID
and Donations.DateID = Dates.DateID
ORDER BY Donations.DateID DESC, Donations.Donated DESC;

//ORDERED BY Received
SELECT Members.IGN, Donations.Donated, Donations.Received, Donations.Net, Dates.Date
FROM Members JOIN Donations JOIN Dates
ON Members.MemberID = Donations.MemberID
and Donations.DateID = Dates.DateID
ORDER BY Donations.DateID DESC, Donations.Received DESC;


//Inserting dates
Find dates via the following command:

SELECT Dates.DateID FROM Dates WHERE Dates.Date == $Date

//If no row found, prevent insertion of donations.
//After selecting date ID, store DateID in the variable $ID.

Use JQuery to do the following:
Insert Donations Here:
count = 0;
#while (count < 50) // Input maximum 50 entries at one go
For each count, there is a form:
Member: (which will be using JSON for user to select possible choices via dropdown based on input) Donated: (Int) Received: (Int)
    count++;
#endwhile

For all entries, compute NET = Donated - Received
INSERT INTO Donations (MemberID, DateID, Donated, Received, NET) VALUES ((SELECT Members.MemberID WHERE Members.IGN = $name), $ID, $don, $rec, $net)


QUERY #5 - Add Clan Games score ----------------------
(Similar to Donations)
To see the clan game score for all members, see the following:

// ORDERED BY Decreasing Points:
SELECT Members.IGN, ClanGames.Points, Dates.Date
FROM Members JOIN ClanGames JOIN Dates
ON Members.MemberID = ClanGames.MemberID
and ClanGames.DateID = Dates.DateID
ORDER BY ClanGames.DateID DESC, ClanGames.Points DESC;

FROM Members JOIN ClanGames JOIN Dates
ON Members.MemberID = ClanGames.MemberID
and ClanGames.DateID = Dates.DateID
ORDER BY ClanGames.DateID DESC, ClanGames.Points ASC;

//To add Points into DB
--> first input month into column, accept only months in DB

SELECT Dates.DateID FROM Dates WHERE Dates.Date == $Date

//After a valid date is entered, enter donations for that month and insert it  via the following command:
INSERT INTO ClanGames (DateID, MemberID, Points) VALUES ($date, (SELECT Members.MemberID FROM Members WHERE Members.IGN = $name), $pts);

QUERY #6 - Add Clan War count ------------------------------
This page will first ask a user to enter the month and it will verify date entered based on the month, with the following code:

SELECT Dates.DateID FROM Dates WHERE Dates.Date = "$date"

If no rows are found, the user should see "No records found" and an option to return.

If rows are found, the clan war count should be displayed in the format of a table. A plus "+" button should be there to increase a player's war count by 1. The + button contains the value of the MemberID of the player, and increases the count by 1 upon confirmation via the following query:

UPDATE ClanWars SET Count = Count + 1 WHERE ClanWars.MemberID = $MemID and ClanWars.DateID = Dates.DateID;

QUERY #7A - Promote Member---------------
SQL Command:
If PositionID  == 3 or 2,
UPDATE Members SET PositionID = PositionID-1 WHERE Members.MemberID = $MemID;

QUERY #7B - Demote Member ---------------
SQL Command:
If Position ID == 1 or 2,
UPDATE Members SET PositionID = PositionID+1 WHERE Members.MemberID = $MemID;

QUERY #7C - Edit Member Profile ----------
(editmember.php)
Form about the same as the add user portion. edit sends a GET parameter using the MemberID
SELECT Members.IGN, Members.Thlvl, Members.TeleName, Members.Bio, Members.Strategies FROM Members WHERE Members.MemberID = $MemID;

//And fill these inputs into the same form.
Reinsert these values into the database upon updating.
